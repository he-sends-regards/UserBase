# User base system
<div>
    In the course of this project, I created an application<br>
    that is a database of users, with the ability to register<br>
    new users by creating new accounts and adding them to the database.<br>
    As well as using the visual modeling language UML diagrams were constructed:<br>
- Use-case diagrams<br>
- Sequence diagram<br>
- Cooperation diagrams<br>
- Class diagram<br>
- States (statechart diagram)<br>
The software implementation was performed using the Java programming language.<br>

    When you start the program, the first window opens (StartWindow) with the<br>
    further possibility to choose registration or login to an already registered account:<br>

    When you open the RegisterWindow, we see the following form:<br>
    <img src="Screenshots/register_win_1.png"><br>
    Until we registered a new user, the database looks like this:<br>
    <img src="Screenshots/base_before.png"><br>
    Fill in the registration form:<br>
    <img src="Screenshots/register_win_2.png"><br>
    After adding a new user, the database looks like this:<br>
    <img src="Screenshots/base_after.png"><br>
    The following is the login window:<br>
    <img src="Screenshots/login_win_1.png"><br>
    Fill in the fields:<br>
    <img src="Screenshots/login_win_2.png"><br>
    Following, if such a user is found in the database, an account window (MainWindow) will open:<br>
