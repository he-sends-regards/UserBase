    In the course of this project, I created an application<br>
    that is a database of users, with the ability to register<br>
    new users by creating new accounts and adding them to the database.<br>
    As well as using the visual modeling language UML diagrams were constructed:<br>
- Use-case diagrams<br>
- Sequence diagram<br>
- Cooperation diagrams<br>
- Class diagram<br>
- States (statechart diagram)<br>
The software implementation was performed using the Java programming language.
